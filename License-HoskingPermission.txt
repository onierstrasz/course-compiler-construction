Subject: Re: Compiler Construction course -- can I adapt material and make it available under Creative Commons?

Dear Oscar,

My apologies -- I have been traveling.

You are most welcome to make use of my notes.  I have two versions, one set for graduate students and another for undergrads.  Both are available at http://www.cs.purdue.edu/~hosking/352/notes and http://www.cs.purdue.edu/~hosking/502/notes, respectively.  The grad notes also draw on material other than Appel.

I can make both available to you in source LaTeX form as well, if that is useful to you.  Also, I am happy to relax my assertion of copyright as best fits Creative Commons -- I should really switch to that license myself.

Please let me know if you need anything else, and I promise I will respond in a more timely fashion.

Best regards,

Tony

Hi Tony,

Not sure if you got my previous request -- as far as I know I did not get a response, so I am asking again.

I would like to base a course on Jens' compiler book, and am interested in adapting your lecture material.

Your lecture notes state:

"Copyright (c) 2006 by Antony L. Hosking. Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for
personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or
commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and full citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, to
republish, to post on servers, or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or fee. Request
permission to publish from hosking@cs.purdue.edu."

However I make my own lecture notes available under Creative Commons Share Alike 3.0, and post them on our svn server.

https://www.iam.unibe.ch/scg/svn_repos/Lectures/

Do I have your permission to use adapt parts of your lecture notes, provided I give credit to the relevant pages?

I am just worried that your copyright notice may not be compatible with Creative Commons, so I need your permission to proceed.

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

Please let me know in either case, as I would like to start preparing my lecture notes ASAP.

Cheers,
Oscar
